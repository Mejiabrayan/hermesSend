# Server Actions Folder

This folder contains all server actions for our application. These actions are responsible for handling mutations and data modifications within our database. They should only be executed on the server side.

## Purpose

The functions in this folder are designed to:

1. Handle all create, update, and delete operations on our database
2. Encapsulate server-side logic for data mutations
3. Provide a clear separation between client-side and server-side operations

## Examples

Some examples of actions you might find in this folder:

- `create-user.ts`: Handles user creation in the database
- `update-profile.ts`: Updates user profile information
- `delete-post.ts`: Removes a post from the database
- `add-comment.ts`: Adds a new comment to a post

## Usage

These actions should be imported and used only in:

1. Server components
2. API routes

Do not import or use these actions in client-side components or code.

## Guidelines

When adding new actions to this folder:

1. Name the file descriptively, indicating the primary operation (e.g., `create-product.ts`)
2. Ensure the action is properly typed and handles errors gracefully
3. Include appropriate validation and security checks
4. Use consistent error handling and return formats across all actions

By following these guidelines, we maintain a clean and secure separation between client and server operations in our application.
